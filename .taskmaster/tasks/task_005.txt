  RecoverSecret(shares []Share, threshold int) ([]byte, error)
  CreateMultiSigAddress(publicKeys []PublicKey, threshold int) (Address, error)
  SignTransaction(shares []Share, transaction Transaction) (Signature, error)
  VerifyMultiSig(address Address, message []byte, signature Signature) (bool, error)
}

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for Shamir's Secret Sharing implementation
2. Verify correct reconstruction with different threshold combinations
3. Test multi-signature address generation and verification
4. Test threshold signature generation and verification
5. Verify security properties under various attack scenarios
6. Test performance with different threshold configurations
7. Integration tests with blockchain networks supporting multi-sig
8. Verify compatibility with industry standards

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Shamir's Secret Sharing Algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the core mathematical foundation for threshold signatures using Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm.
### Details:
Create functions for polynomial generation, secret splitting into N shares, and reconstruction requiring M shares. Implement finite field arithmetic operations needed for the algorithm. Include thorough unit tests verifying correct reconstruction with exactly M shares and security against fewer shares. Document the mathematical principles behind the implementation.

## 2. Design Secure Key Distribution Protocol [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create a secure mechanism for distributing key shares to authorized participants.
### Details:
Implement encrypted channels for share distribution using TLS/SSL. Design participant authentication and authorization mechanisms. Create a key registry to track which participants hold which shares (without revealing the shares themselves). Implement secure deletion protocols for temporary data during the distribution process. Add logging for distribution events while maintaining privacy.

## 3. Develop M-of-N Multi-Signature Scheme [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Implement the core multi-signature functionality allowing M out of N participants to create valid signatures.
### Details:
Create data structures for representing partial signatures. Implement the signature creation protocol for individual participants. Design the communication protocol for participants to exchange partial signatures. Develop the signature aggregation algorithm that combines M partial signatures into a complete signature. Include verification mechanisms to detect invalid partial signatures.

## 4. Implement Signature Verification System [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Create robust verification procedures to validate signatures created through the threshold scheme.
### Details:
Develop functions to verify the validity of aggregated signatures against the original message. Implement checks to ensure exactly M valid participants contributed to the signature. Create mechanisms to prevent replay attacks and signature reuse. Design an API for external systems to verify signatures. Include performance optimizations for verification operations.

## 5. Create Policy Enforcement Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Develop a system to define and enforce policies regarding which participants can sign which types of transactions.
### Details:
Design a policy definition language for specifying signing rules. Implement policy validation during the signature process. Create mechanisms for policy updates that maintain security. Develop audit trails for policy enforcement actions. Include support for time-based policies and emergency override procedures with additional verification requirements.

## 6. Perform Security Analysis and Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5
### Description: Conduct comprehensive security analysis and performance optimization of the entire implementation.
### Details:
Perform formal security analysis of the cryptographic protocols. Conduct penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities. Optimize performance bottlenecks in the implementation. Create benchmarks for different M and N configurations. Document security guarantees and limitations. Develop recommendations for secure deployment configurations based on threat models.
