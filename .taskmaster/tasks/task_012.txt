# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Authentication and Authorization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop comprehensive authentication and authorization systems with role-based access control for API security.
# Details:
1. Implement JWT-based authentication
2. Create role-based access control (RBAC) system
3. Develop permission models for all operations
4. Implement API key authentication
5. Add OAuth 2.0 support for external authentication
6. Create user and role management
7. Implement audit logging for authentication events
8. Add rate limiting based on authentication

Example implementation:
```go
type AuthService interface {
  Authenticate(credentials Credentials) (Token, error)
  ValidateToken(token string) (Claims, error)
  Authorize(claims Claims, resource string, action string) (bool, error)
  GenerateAPIKey(user string, permissions []Permission) (APIKey, error)
  RevokeToken(token string) error
}

type RBACService interface {
  CreateRole(role Role) error
  AssignRole(user string, role string) error
  CheckPermission(user string, resource string, action string) (bool, error)
  ListUserRoles(user string) ([]Role, error)
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for authentication and authorization
2. Test token generation and validation
3. Verify RBAC enforcement
4. Test API key authentication
5. Verify OAuth integration
6. Test permission checks for all operations
7. Verify audit logging
8. Test rate limiting
9. Test with invalid credentials and tokens

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement JWT Authentication System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the JWT authentication system for user login and session management
### Details:
Create JWT token generation, validation, and refresh mechanisms. Implement secure token storage, expiration handling, and blacklisting for revoked tokens. Set up middleware for JWT verification on protected routes. Include proper error handling for invalid or expired tokens.

## 2. Develop Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Create a comprehensive RBAC system with role definitions and hierarchies
### Details:
Define role hierarchy (e.g., admin, manager, user). Implement role assignment and verification mechanisms. Create database schema for roles and role-user relationships. Develop middleware for role-based route protection. Include functionality to add/remove roles from users.

## 3. Implement Granular Permission Models [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Design and implement detailed permission models that integrate with the RBAC system
### Details:
Create permission definitions for all system resources and actions. Implement permission checking middleware. Develop database schema for permissions and permission-role relationships. Create APIs for permission management. Implement caching for permission checks to improve performance.

## 4. Set Up API Key Authentication [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Implement API key generation, validation, and management for service-to-service authentication
### Details:
Create secure API key generation mechanism. Implement API key validation middleware. Develop database schema for storing and managing API keys. Create rate limiting for API key usage. Build admin interface for API key management including creation, revocation, and usage monitoring.

## 5. Integrate OAuth Authentication [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Implement OAuth 2.0 integration with major providers (Google, Facebook, GitHub)
### Details:
Set up OAuth client configurations for multiple providers. Implement OAuth callback handling and user profile retrieval. Create account linking between OAuth and local accounts. Handle token refresh and revocation. Implement proper error handling for OAuth failures.

## 6. Implement Security Audit Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5
### Description: Create comprehensive audit logging for all authentication and authorization events
### Details:
Design and implement audit log schema. Create logging middleware for all auth events (login, logout, permission changes, etc.). Implement secure storage for audit logs. Create admin interface for log review and filtering. Set up alerts for suspicious activities. Ensure compliance with security best practices for log retention.
