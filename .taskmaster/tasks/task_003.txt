# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement HD Wallet Core Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet core functionality with BIP32, BIP39, and BIP44 support for secure key derivation and management.
# Details:
1. Implement BIP39 mnemonic generation and validation
2. Implement BIP32 hierarchical deterministic key derivation
3. Implement BIP44 multi-account hierarchy
4. Create secure seed generation with entropy validation
5. Implement key derivation path validation and normalization
6. Support for hardened and non-hardened key derivation
7. Implement child key derivation with proper index handling
8. Create utility functions for mnemonic handling and validation
9. Implement secure storage interfaces for seeds and keys

Example code:
```go
type HDWallet interface {
  GenerateMnemonic(entropyBits int) (string, error)
  NewWalletFromMnemonic(mnemonic string, passphrase string) (*Wallet, error)
  NewWalletFromSeed(seed []byte) (*Wallet, error)
  DeriveKey(path string) (*Key, error)
  Sign(path string, message []byte) ([]byte, error)
  Verify(path string, message, signature []byte) (bool, error)
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for all HD wallet functions
2. Test against BIP test vectors for BIP32, BIP39, and BIP44
3. Verify correct derivation paths for multiple cryptocurrencies
4. Test mnemonic generation entropy and validation
5. Verify key derivation performance meets requirements
6. Test compatibility with external wallets using the same standards
7. Verify secure cleanup of sensitive memory after operations
