# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Monitoring and Observability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 11, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop comprehensive monitoring and observability features including metrics, tracing, and health checks.
# Details:
1. Implement Prometheus metrics for all key operations
2. Add distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
3. Create health check endpoints
4. Implement readiness and liveness probes
5. Add custom metrics for business KPIs
6. Create Grafana dashboard templates
7. Implement alerting rules
8. Add performance profiling endpoints

Example metrics:
```go
var (
  keyOperationsTotal = prometheus.NewCounterVec(
    prometheus.CounterOpts{
      Name: "skms_key_operations_total",
      Help: "Total number of key operations",
    },
    []string{"operation", "status"},
  )
  keyOperationDuration = prometheus.NewHistogramVec(
    prometheus.HistogramOpts{
      Name:    "skms_key_operation_duration_seconds",
      Help:    "Duration of key operations",
      Buckets: prometheus.DefBuckets,
    },
    []string{"operation"},
  )
)
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for metrics collection
2. Verify metric values under different scenarios
3. Test health check endpoints
4. Verify tracing data collection
5. Test dashboard templates
6. Verify alerting rules
7. Test performance profiling
8. Verify integration with monitoring systems
9. Test under load to verify metric accuracy

# Subtasks:

2. Implement /health and /ready endpoints
3. Configure basic system metrics (CPU, memory, request counts)
4. Set up Prometheus scraping configuration
5. Test metric collection with local Prometheus instance
6. Document standard metrics and health check responses

## 2. Implement OpenTelemetry Tracing [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Add distributed tracing capabilities using OpenTelemetry to track request flows across services
### Details:
1. Add OpenTelemetry libraries to the application
2. Configure trace sampling and exporters
3. Instrument key service methods and API endpoints
4. Add context propagation between services
5. Set up trace visualization with Jaeger or Zipkin
6. Create example traces for common user journeys

## 3. Develop Custom Business Metrics and SLIs [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Define and implement custom metrics relevant to business operations and Service Level Indicators
### Details:
1. Identify key business processes to monitor
2. Define Service Level Indicators (SLIs) for critical paths
3. Implement custom counters, gauges, and histograms
4. Add metrics for API latency, error rates, and throughput
5. Create metrics for database operations and external service calls
6. Document custom metrics with their significance and expected ranges

## 4. Create Dashboards and Alerting Rules [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2, 14.3
### Description: Develop monitoring dashboards and configure alerting rules for proactive issue detection
### Details:
1. Design dashboard templates for Grafana
