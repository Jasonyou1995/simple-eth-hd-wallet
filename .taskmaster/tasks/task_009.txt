# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Secure Storage Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a secure storage layer for encrypted key storage, metadata, and sensitive configuration with proper encryption and access controls.
# Details:
1. Design encrypted storage format for keys and metadata
2. Implement pluggable storage backends (file, database, cloud)
3. Create encryption/decryption layer for all stored data
4. Implement access control for storage operations
5. Add support for key-value storage with encryption
6. Develop backup and recovery mechanisms
7. Implement storage migration utilities
8. Create storage health monitoring

Example interface:
```go
type SecureStorage interface {
  Store(key string, data []byte, metadata Metadata) error
  Retrieve(key string) ([]byte, Metadata, error)
  Delete(key string) error
  List(prefix string) ([]string, error)
  Backup(destination string) error
  Restore(source string) error
  RotateEncryptionKey(oldKey, newKey []byte) error
}

type StorageBackend interface {
  Init(config BackendConfig) error
  Read(key string) ([]byte, error)
  Write(key string, data []byte) error
  Delete(key string) error
  List(prefix string) ([]string, error)
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for storage operations
2. Test encryption/decryption correctness
3. Verify access control enforcement
4. Test backup and recovery procedures
5. Benchmark storage performance
6. Test concurrent access patterns
7. Verify data integrity after storage operations
8. Test storage migration
9. Verify proper cleanup of sensitive data

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Encrypted Storage Format [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the structure and format for storing encrypted data, including metadata, versioning, and integrity verification.
### Details:
Create a detailed specification for the encrypted storage format that includes: encryption header structure, payload format, integrity verification mechanisms (HMAC/signatures), version information for future compatibility, and metadata storage approach. Consider format extensibility and backward compatibility requirements. Document the complete format specification with diagrams and examples.

## 2. Implement Pluggable Storage Backend Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create an abstraction layer that allows different storage backends (filesystem, cloud storage, database) to be used interchangeably.
### Details:
Design and implement a storage provider interface with standard operations (read, write, delete, list). Create concrete implementations for at least filesystem and one cloud storage provider. Include configuration mechanisms for each backend, connection pooling where appropriate, and error handling specific to each storage type. Implement automated tests for each backend implementation.

## 3. Develop Encryption/Decryption Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement the core cryptographic functionality for securing data at rest, including key management.
### Details:
Implement encryption/decryption services using industry-standard algorithms (AES-256-GCM recommended). Create a key management system supporting key rotation, derivation, and secure storage. Implement envelope encryption for large data sets. Add cryptographic operation logging for audit purposes. Ensure all implementations follow cryptographic best practices and include comprehensive unit tests with test vectors.

## 4. Implement Access Control System [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Create a permission system that controls which users or services can access specific encrypted data.
### Details:
Design and implement role-based access control for the secure storage layer. Create permission models for different data categories. Implement authentication integration with the existing system. Add audit logging for all access attempts. Create an API for permission management. Develop a caching layer for frequently accessed permissions to improve performance. Include comprehensive tests for various access scenarios.

## 5. Develop Backup and Recovery Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Implement systems for reliable data backup, integrity verification, and recovery procedures.
### Details:
Create automated backup scheduling with configurable frequency. Implement point-in-time recovery capabilities. Add backup integrity verification using cryptographic checksums. Develop secure backup storage with encryption. Create a disaster recovery plan and implementation guide. Build a backup testing and validation system. Implement backup monitoring and alerting. Create a user-friendly recovery interface with appropriate access controls.
