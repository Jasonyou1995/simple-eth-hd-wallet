# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with proper structure, configuration, and CI/CD setup. Establish the foundational architecture for the Secure Key Management System.
# Details:
1. Create a new Go project with Go 1.21+ compatibility
2. Set up directory structure following Go best practices:
   - cmd/ (entry points)
   - internal/ (private packages)
   - pkg/ (public packages)
   - api/ (API definitions)
   - docs/ (documentation)
3. Configure Git with proper .gitignore for Go projects
4. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD with:
   - Automated testing
   - Code quality checks
   - Security scanning
5. Initialize Go modules and dependencies
6. Create Docker and Kubernetes configuration files
7. Document the system architecture based on the 5 layers specified in the PRD:
   - Core Engine
   - API Layer
   - Security Layer
   - Storage Layer
   - Integration Layer

# Test Strategy:
Verify that:
1. Project builds successfully
2. CI/CD pipeline runs correctly
3. Docker container builds and runs
4. All initial dependencies resolve correctly
5. Architecture documentation is complete and aligned with PRD requirements
