# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement RESTful API with OpenAPI Specification
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement a comprehensive RESTful API with OpenAPI specification for all key management operations.
# Details:
1. Design RESTful API endpoints for all key management operations
2. Create OpenAPI 3.0 specification document
3. Implement API handlers using Go standard library or frameworks
4. Add request validation and sanitization
5. Implement proper HTTP status codes and error responses
6. Add pagination for list operations
7. Implement filtering and sorting
8. Create API versioning strategy
9. Generate API documentation from OpenAPI spec

Example API endpoints:
```
POST /api/v1/keys - Create a new key
GET /api/v1/keys/{id} - Retrieve key information
PUT /api/v1/keys/{id} - Update key metadata
DELETE /api/v1/keys/{id} - Delete/revoke a key
POST /api/v1/keys/{id}/rotate - Rotate a key
POST /api/v1/sign - Sign a message
POST /api/v1/verify - Verify a signature
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for API handlers
2. Integration tests for API endpoints
3. Validate OpenAPI specification
4. Test API versioning
5. Verify proper error handling
6. Test pagination, filtering, and sorting
7. Benchmark API performance
8. Test with invalid inputs and edge cases
9. Verify API documentation accuracy

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design RESTful API endpoints and resource structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the complete API resource hierarchy, HTTP methods, and endpoint paths for all key management operations
### Details:
Create a comprehensive endpoint design document that includes: resource paths (/keys, /keys/{id}, etc.), HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), query parameters for filtering and pagination, request/response payload structures, status codes for various scenarios, and authentication requirements for each endpoint. Consider versioning strategy (e.g., /v1/keys) and ensure the design follows RESTful principles.

## 2. Create OpenAPI specification document [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop a complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification that formally defines the API
### Details:
Using the endpoint design from subtask 1, create a detailed OpenAPI 3.0 specification in YAML format. Include all paths, operations, request parameters, request bodies, response schemas, examples, security schemes, and error responses. Define reusable components for common schemas. Ensure the specification is valid according to OpenAPI validation tools and includes proper documentation for all elements.

## 3. Implement API request handlers and core logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Develop the handler functions for each API endpoint that connect to the core key management functionality
### Details:
Implement handler functions for each API endpoint defined in the specification. This includes creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting cryptographic keys, as well as any key rotation or validation operations. Ensure handlers properly integrate with the authentication system and core cryptographic functionality. Structure code following clean architecture principles with separation of concerns between API layer and business logic.

## 4. Implement request validation and error handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Add comprehensive validation for all API inputs and standardized error handling
### Details:
Implement validation for all request parameters, headers, and body payloads. Create middleware for common validation tasks. Develop a standardized error handling system that returns appropriate HTTP status codes and consistent error response formats. Include validation for: data types, required fields, string formats, numeric ranges, enumerated values, and business rule validations. Implement detailed error logging that doesn't expose sensitive information in responses.

## 5. Implement pagination, filtering and documentation generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.4
### Description: Add support for result pagination, filtering, and generate developer documentation
### Details:
Implement cursor-based or offset-based pagination for collection endpoints with configurable page sizes. Add filtering capabilities based on query parameters. Generate comprehensive API documentation from the OpenAPI specification, including interactive documentation using tools like Swagger UI or ReDoc. Include usage examples, authentication instructions, and rate limiting information in the documentation. Test pagination with large datasets to ensure performance.
