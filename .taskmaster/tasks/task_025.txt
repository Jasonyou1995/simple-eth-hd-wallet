# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Testing Framework and Quality Assurance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop comprehensive testing framework and quality assurance processes to ensure system reliability, security, and performance.
# Details:
1. Implement unit testing framework
2. Create integration testing suite
3. Implement security testing
4. Add performance testing
5. Implement compliance testing
6. Create test automation
7. Add code coverage reporting
8. Implement continuous testing in CI/CD

Testing strategy:
1. Unit Testing
   - >95% code coverage
   - Test all business logic
   - Mock external dependencies
2. Integration Testing
   - End-to-end scenarios
   - API contract testing
   - Component interaction testing
3. Security Testing
   - Penetration testing
   - Code audits
   - Dependency scanning
4. Performance Testing
   - Load testing
   - Stress testing
   - Endurance testing
5. Compliance Testing
   - Standards validation
   - Regulatory compliance checks

Example test code:
```go
func TestKeyGeneration(t *testing.T) {
  engine := crypto.NewCryptoEngine()
  key, err := engine.GenerateKey(crypto.KeyTypeECDSA, crypto.CurveP256)
  assert.NoError(t, err)
  assert.NotNil(t, key)
  assert.Equal(t, crypto.KeyTypeECDSA, key.Type)
  assert.Equal(t, crypto.CurveP256, key.Params.Curve)
  
  // Test signing and verification
  message := []byte("test message")
  signature, err := engine.Sign(key, message)
  assert.NoError(t, err)
  
  valid, err := engine.Verify(key.Public(), message, signature)
  assert.NoError(t, err)
  assert.True(t, valid)
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify test coverage meets targets
2. Test the testing framework itself
3. Verify integration tests cover critical paths
4. Test security testing effectiveness
5. Verify performance testing accuracy
6. Test compliance validation
7. Verify test automation reliability
8. Test continuous testing in CI/CD

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Unit Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a comprehensive unit testing framework for all cryptographic components
### Details:
Create unit tests for individual cryptographic functions, key management operations, and core algorithms. Implement test cases for normal operation, edge cases, and error handling. Use mocking to isolate components. Ensure test coverage of at least 90% for all core cryptographic functions. Include validation of expected outputs against known test vectors from cryptographic standards.

## 2. Develop Integration Testing Suite [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Create tests that verify correct interaction between system components
### Details:
Design test scenarios that validate end-to-end workflows across multiple components. Test API interactions, data flow between modules, and system boundaries. Implement tests for key rotation, certificate management, and cryptographic operations in a full system context. Include negative testing scenarios to verify proper error propagation and handling between components.

## 3. Implement Security Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1, 25.2
### Description: Develop specialized tests for cryptographic security properties
### Details:
Create tests for side-channel attack resistance, key extraction attempts, and protocol vulnerabilities. Implement fuzzing tests for input validation. Develop tests for timing attacks, fault injection, and other cryptographic vulnerabilities. Include penetration testing scenarios and security boundary verification. Validate secure key storage and memory handling during cryptographic operations.

## 4. Create Performance Testing Suite [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Develop benchmarks and performance tests for cryptographic operations
### Details:
Implement benchmarking tools for measuring throughput, latency, and resource usage of cryptographic operations. Create tests for performance under various loads and data sizes. Develop stress tests for concurrent operations and key management at scale. Include memory profiling and CPU utilization analysis. Test performance degradation scenarios and recovery capabilities.

## 5. Establish Compliance Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1, 25.3
### Description: Develop tests to verify adherence to cryptographic standards and regulations
### Details:
Create test suites for FIPS 140-2/3 compliance validation. Implement tests for algorithm conformance to NIST standards. Develop validation procedures for key length requirements, approved algorithms, and secure random number generation. Include tests for proper implementation of cryptographic protocols (TLS, SSH, etc.) according to relevant RFCs and standards.

## 6. Implement Test Automation Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1, 25.2, 25.3, 25.4, 25.5
### Description: Develop CI/CD pipeline integration for automated test execution
### Details:
Create automated test runners for continuous integration environments. Implement test result reporting and analysis tools. Develop regression test selection mechanisms. Create automated security scan integration. Implement test environment provisioning and teardown automation. Develop documentation generation from test results and coverage reports.
