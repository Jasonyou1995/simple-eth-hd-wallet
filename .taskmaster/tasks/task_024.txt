# Task ID: 24
# Title: Implement Deployment and DevOps Tooling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop comprehensive deployment and DevOps tooling for containerization, orchestration, and continuous delivery.
# Details:
1. Create Docker containerization
2. Implement Kubernetes deployment manifests
3. Add Helm charts for easy deployment
4. Implement CI/CD pipelines
5. Create infrastructure as code (Terraform, etc.)
6. Add configuration management
7. Implement secrets management
8. Create deployment documentation

Example Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.21-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go mod download
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o skms ./cmd/skms

FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates
WORKDIR /root/
COPY --from=builder /app/skms .
EXPOSE 8080 9090
CMD ["./skms"]
```

Example Kubernetes manifest:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: skms
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: skms
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: skms
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: skms
        image: skms:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        - containerPort: 9090
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8080
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /ready
            port: 8080
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Test Docker builds
2. Verify Kubernetes deployments
3. Test Helm chart installation
4. Verify CI/CD pipelines
5. Test infrastructure as code
6. Verify configuration management
7. Test secrets management
8. Verify deployment documentation
9. Test scaling and high availability

# Subtasks:
## 1. Docker Containerization Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create Docker images for all application components with security best practices
### Details:
Develop Dockerfiles for each microservice with multi-stage builds to minimize image size. Implement security scanning for vulnerabilities, use non-root users, and implement proper secrets management. Include health checks and appropriate base images. Document the build process and image versioning strategy.

## 2. Kubernetes Manifest Development [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Create Kubernetes manifests for all application components with proper security configurations
### Details:
Develop YAML manifests for deployments, services, ingress, network policies, and resource quotas. Implement pod security policies, RBAC configurations, and namespace isolation. Configure liveness and readiness probes, resource limits, and affinity rules for optimal deployment. Document the manifest structure and deployment dependencies.

## 3. Helm Chart Creation [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.2
### Description: Develop Helm charts for simplified application deployment and configuration management
### Details:
Create Helm charts with proper templating for environment-specific configurations. Implement value files for different environments (dev, staging, prod). Include dependency management, hooks for database migrations, and proper versioning. Document chart usage, customization options, and upgrade procedures.

## 4. CI/CD Pipeline Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1, 24.2, 24.3
### Description: Set up automated build, test, and deployment pipelines with security gates
### Details:
Implement CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions or Jenkins. Configure automated testing, security scanning, and deployment approval workflows. Set up promotion between environments with proper validation gates. Implement automated rollback mechanisms and deployment verification. Document pipeline structure and manual intervention points.

## 5. Infrastructure as Code and Configuration Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.4
### Description: Implement IaC for infrastructure provisioning and configuration management
### Details:
Develop Terraform modules for cloud infrastructure provisioning (compute, networking, storage). Implement configuration management using tools like Ansible for system configuration. Set up secret management with tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager. Document the infrastructure architecture, provisioning process, and disaster recovery procedures.
