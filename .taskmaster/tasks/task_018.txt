# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement CLI Tool
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive command-line interface (CLI) tool for key management operations and administration.
# Details:
1. Design CLI command structure and help system
2. Implement key management commands
3. Add wallet operations
4. Implement signing and verification commands
5. Add configuration management
6. Implement interactive mode with rich features
7. Create shell completion scripts
8. Add colorized output and progress indicators

Example CLI commands:
```
skms key create --type=ecdsa --curve=secp256k1
skms key list --filter="status=active"
skms wallet create --mnemonic-strength=256
skms wallet derive --path="m/44'/0'/0'/0/0"
skms sign --key=key-123 --message="Hello, world!"
skms verify --key=key-123 --message="Hello, world!" --signature=abcdef...
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for CLI commands
2. Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
3. Test help system and documentation
4. Verify error handling and user feedback
5. Test interactive mode
6. Verify shell completion
7. Test with invalid inputs and edge cases
8. Usability testing with different user personas

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design CLI Command Structure and Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design the overall command structure, subcommand organization, and help documentation for the CLI tool
### Details:
Create a comprehensive CLI architecture with main command groups (key management, wallet operations, signing/verification). Define command naming conventions, parameter formats, and help text templates. Select appropriate CLI framework/library. Implement the base CLI application with argument parsing, error handling, and help documentation generation.

## 2. Implement Key Management Commands [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Develop commands for key generation, import/export, and key management operations
### Details:
Implement commands for: generating new key pairs with various algorithms, importing keys from files/formats, exporting keys in different formats, listing available keys, showing key details, and deleting keys. Include proper validation, secure handling of private key material, and appropriate feedback messages.

## 3. Implement Wallet and Transaction Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2
### Description: Create commands for wallet creation, balance checking, and transaction operations
### Details:
Implement commands for: creating/managing wallets, checking balances, listing transactions, creating new transactions, and broadcasting transactions. Include support for different blockchain networks, fee estimation, and transaction status checking. Ensure proper error handling for network issues.

## 4. Implement Signing/Verification and Interactive Mode [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.3
### Description: Add commands for message signing/verification and develop an interactive shell mode
### Details:
Implement commands for: signing messages/data with private keys, verifying signatures with public keys, batch operations for multiple signatures. Develop an interactive shell mode with command history, tab completion, context-aware help, and persistent sessions. Include comprehensive documentation and usage examples for all commands.
