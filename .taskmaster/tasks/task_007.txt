# Title: Implement Post-Quantum Cryptography Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement post-quantum cryptographic algorithms to prepare for quantum computing threats, including Dilithium and Falcon signature schemes.
# Details:
1. Implement NIST-approved post-quantum algorithms
2. Add support for Dilithium signature scheme
3. Add support for Falcon signature scheme
4. Implement hybrid classical/post-quantum schemes
5. Create migration paths from classical to post-quantum
6. Implement key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs)
7. Add parameter selection based on security levels
8. Create benchmarking for post-quantum algorithms

Example implementation:
```go
type PostQuantumScheme interface {
  GenerateKeyPair() (PrivateKey, PublicKey, error)
  Sign(privateKey PrivateKey, message []byte) (Signature, error)
  Verify(publicKey PublicKey, message []byte, signature Signature) (bool, error)
  GetSecurityLevel() SecurityLevel
}

func NewDilithiumScheme(params DilithiumParams) PostQuantumScheme {
  // Implementation
}

func NewFalconScheme(params FalconParams) PostQuantumScheme {
  // Implementation
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for each post-quantum algorithm
2. Test against NIST test vectors
3. Verify correctness of implementations
4. Benchmark performance compared to classical algorithms
5. Test memory usage and optimization
6. Verify compatibility with existing systems
7. Test hybrid schemes for security properties
8. Verify parameter selection for different security levels

### Details:
Design hybrid signature and encryption schemes that combine classical and post-quantum algorithms. Implement composite signatures (e.g., RSA+Dilithium) and hybrid key encapsulation mechanisms (e.g., ECDH+Kyber). Document the security assumptions, performance implications, and proper implementation practices. Create a framework that allows easy configuration of hybrid schemes.
