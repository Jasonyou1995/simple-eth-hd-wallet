# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Documentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 10, 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop comprehensive technical documentation including architecture guides, API references, developer guides, security guides, and operations guides.
# Details:
1. Create architecture documentation with diagrams
2. Generate API reference from OpenAPI and gRPC definitions
3. Write developer guide with integration tutorials
4. Create security guide with threat model
5. Write operations guide for deployment and maintenance
6. Add code examples for common use cases
7. Create troubleshooting guide
8. Implement documentation website with search

Documentation structure:
1. Getting Started
   - Installation
   - Quick Start
   - Basic Concepts
2. Architecture Guide
   - System Components
   - Security Model
   - Data Flow
3. API Reference
   - REST API
   - gRPC API
   - SDK Reference
4. Developer Guide
   - Integration Tutorials
   - Best Practices
   - Code Examples
5. Security Guide
   - Threat Model
   - Security Recommendations
   - Compliance Information
6. Operations Guide
   - Deployment
   - Configuration
   - Monitoring
   - Backup and Recovery

# Test Strategy:
1. Review documentation for accuracy
2. Verify code examples work as documented
3. Test documentation search functionality
4. Verify API reference matches implementation
5. Review by different user personas (developers, operators, security)
6. Test documentation website on different devices
7. Verify links and references
8. Collect and incorporate user feedback

# Subtasks:
## 1. System Architecture Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation of the system architecture including component diagrams, data flow, and cryptographic mechanisms
### Details:
Document the overall system architecture with detailed diagrams showing all components, their interactions, and data flows. Include explanations of cryptographic primitives used, key management systems, and security boundaries. Create both high-level overviews for general understanding and detailed technical specifications for implementers.

## 2. API Reference Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Generate complete API reference documentation with endpoints, parameters, authentication requirements, and example requests/responses
### Details:
Document all API endpoints with their parameters, return values, error codes, and authentication requirements. Include example requests and responses for each endpoint. Use OpenAPI/Swagger specifications where applicable. Ensure documentation covers both internal and external APIs, with appropriate access control information.

## 3. Developer Implementation Guides [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.2
### Description: Create developer-focused guides for implementation, integration, and SDK usage with code examples
### Details:
Develop comprehensive guides for developers including quickstart tutorials, integration examples, and best practices. Include code samples in multiple languages, troubleshooting sections, and common implementation patterns. Cover SDK usage, library integration, and custom implementation approaches.

## 4. Security and Operations Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Develop security guidelines, threat models, and operational procedures for deployment and maintenance
### Details:
Create security documentation including threat models, security best practices, and compliance considerations. Develop operational guides covering deployment procedures, monitoring requirements, backup strategies, key rotation policies, and incident response procedures. Include checklists for secure configuration and regular maintenance tasks.

## 5. Documentation Website Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2, 20.3, 20.4
### Description: Implement a searchable, versioned documentation website with appropriate access controls for different user roles
### Details:
Build a documentation website with search functionality, version control for different releases, and appropriate access controls for public vs. private documentation. Implement responsive design for mobile access, syntax highlighting for code examples, and interactive API explorers where applicable. Set up CI/CD for documentation updates and implement feedback mechanisms for users.
