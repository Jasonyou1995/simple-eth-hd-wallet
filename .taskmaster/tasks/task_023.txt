# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Security Hardening
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 9, 12, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive security hardening measures to protect against various attack vectors and ensure system integrity.
# Details:
1. Implement secure configuration defaults
2. Add protection against timing attacks
3. Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection
4. Add input validation and sanitization
5. Implement secure headers and TLS configuration
6. Add protection against common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
7. Implement secure coding practices
8. Add runtime security monitoring

Security measures:
1. Defense in Depth
   - Multiple security layers
   - Compartmentalization
2. Least Privilege
   - Minimal permission models
   - Principle of least authority
3. Secure by Default
   - Safe configuration defaults
   - Explicit opt-in for risky features
4. Fail Secure
   - Graceful failure handling
   - Secure error messages
5. Audit Everything
   - Comprehensive logging
   - Intrusion detection

# Test Strategy:
1. Security code review
2. Static analysis with security tools
3. Dynamic analysis and penetration testing
4. Fuzz testing for input handling
5. Test against known attack vectors
6. Verify secure configuration
7. Test rate limiting and DDoS protection
8. Verify secure error handling
9. Test runtime security monitoring
