# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement HSM and Secure Enclave Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop integration with Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and secure enclaves for enhanced key protection.
# Details:
1. Design pluggable HSM provider interface
2. Implement PKCS#11 integration for HSM support
3. Add support for cloud HSM services (AWS, GCP, Azure)
4. Implement secure enclave support for Apple devices
5. Add TPM integration for Windows and Linux
6. Create key ceremony procedures for HSM initialization
7. Implement key backup and recovery for HSM-stored keys
8. Add performance optimization for HSM operations

Example interface:
```go
type HSMProvider interface {
  Initialize(config HSMConfig) error
  GenerateKey(keyType KeyType, attributes KeyAttributes) (KeyID, error)
  Sign(keyID KeyID, mechanism Mechanism, data []byte) ([]byte, error)
  Verify(keyID KeyID, mechanism Mechanism, data, signature []byte) (bool, error)
  WrapKey(wrappingKeyID, targetKeyID KeyID) ([]byte, error)
  UnwrapKey(wrappingKeyID KeyID, wrappedKey []byte, attributes KeyAttributes) (KeyID, error)
}

func NewPKCS11Provider(config PKCS11Config) HSMProvider {
  // Implementation
}

func NewCloudHSMProvider(config CloudHSMConfig) HSMProvider {
  // Implementation
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests with HSM simulators
2. Integration tests with actual HSM devices where available
3. Verify key operations through HSM
4. Test key backup and recovery
5. Verify secure enclave operations
6. Test performance of HSM operations
7. Verify error handling for HSM failures
8. Test with different HSM vendors and models

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design HSM Provider Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create an abstract provider interface that can support multiple HSM vendors and implementations
### Details:
Design a flexible provider interface that abstracts vendor-specific HSM implementations. Include methods for key generation, signing, encryption/decryption, and key management. Define clear interfaces for initialization, session management, and error handling. Document the interface requirements and expected behavior for different HSM types.

## 2. Implement PKCS#11 Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Develop integration with the PKCS#11 standard for hardware security module communication
### Details:
Implement PKCS#11 library bindings to communicate with HSMs. Create wrapper classes that map the provider interface to PKCS#11 functions. Handle slot management, token initialization, object attributes, and mechanism parameters. Implement proper session handling and resource cleanup. Test with at least two different PKCS#11 implementations.

## 3. Add Cloud HSM Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Extend the HSM provider interface to support major cloud HSM offerings (AWS, Azure, GCP)
### Details:
Implement provider adapters for AWS CloudHSM, Azure Dedicated HSM, and Google Cloud HSM. Create cloud-specific authentication and configuration handlers. Develop key synchronization mechanisms between cloud HSMs. Ensure proper error handling for network-related issues. Document deployment requirements for each cloud provider.

## 4. Integrate Secure Enclave Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Add support for platform-specific secure enclaves like Apple Secure Enclave and Android Strongbox
### Details:
Develop platform-specific modules for Apple Secure Enclave and Android Strongbox/Keystore. Implement key generation and operations within the secure enclaves. Handle biometric authentication integration where applicable. Create fallback mechanisms for devices without secure enclave support. Test on multiple device generations.

## 5. Implement TPM Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Add Trusted Platform Module (TPM) integration for Windows and Linux systems
### Details:
Create TPM 2.0 provider implementation for Windows and Linux. Implement key attestation and verification. Support both discrete and firmware TPM variants. Handle TPM-specific key hierarchies and limitations. Develop migration strategies between TPM and other HSM types. Test on various hardware configurations.

## 6. Develop Key Ceremony Procedures [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, 15.5
### Description: Create secure key ceremony workflows and documentation for HSM initialization and key management
### Details:
Design formal key ceremony procedures for different HSM types. Create documentation for key generation, backup, and recovery processes. Implement multi-party authorization workflows. Develop audit logging for all key operations. Create tools for key ceremony execution and verification. Include procedures for key rotation and emergency revocation.
