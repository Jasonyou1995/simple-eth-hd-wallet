# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Advanced Cryptographic Protocols
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement advanced cryptographic protocols including ECDSA, EdDSA, RSA, BLS, and Schnorr signature schemes to support diverse security requirements.
# Details:
1. Implement ECDSA signature scheme with P-256, P-384, and secp256k1 curves
2. Implement EdDSA (Ed25519) signature scheme
3. Implement RSA signature scheme with PSS padding
4. Implement BLS signatures for aggregation
5. Implement Schnorr signatures for privacy
6. Create unified interface for all signature schemes
7. Implement key conversion between compatible formats
8. Add support for custom parameters and configurations
9. Implement batch verification for performance optimization

Example interface:
```go
type SignatureScheme interface {
  GenerateKeyPair() (PrivateKey, PublicKey, error)
  Sign(privateKey PrivateKey, message []byte) (Signature, error)
  Verify(publicKey PublicKey, message []byte, signature Signature) (bool, error)
  BatchVerify(publicKeys []PublicKey, messages [][]byte, signatures []Signature) (bool, error)
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for each signature scheme
2. Test against known test vectors
3. Verify interoperability with other implementations
4. Performance benchmarks for signing and verification
5. Test batch operations for correctness and performance
6. Verify constant-time implementations
7. Test with invalid inputs and edge cases
8. Verify compatibility with blockchain requirements
