2. Profile memory usage
3. Load test API endpoints
4. Measure throughput under various conditions
5. Test scaling with multiple instances
6. Verify performance meets requirements
7. Identify and address bottlenecks
8. Test with realistic workloads
9. Continuous performance monitoring

# Subtasks:
## 1. Establish Performance Baseline and Profiling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up performance monitoring tools and establish baseline metrics for the current system performance.
### Details:
Install and configure profiling tools (e.g., New Relic, Datadog). Measure and document current response times, throughput, CPU/memory usage, and database query performance. Create a performance test suite that can be used to validate improvements. Document all bottlenecks and prioritize them based on impact.

## 2. Implement Memory Optimization Strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Analyze and optimize memory usage throughout the application.
### Details:
Identify memory leaks using heap analysis. Optimize object lifecycle management. Implement proper garbage collection strategies. Review and optimize data structures for memory efficiency. Reduce unnecessary object creation and implement object pooling where appropriate.

## 3. Implement Database Optimization Techniques [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Optimize database queries, indexes, and schema for improved performance.
### Details:
Analyze slow queries using database profiling tools. Create or optimize indexes based on query patterns. Implement query caching where appropriate. Optimize database schema for performance. Consider denormalization strategies for read-heavy operations. Implement database connection pooling.

## 4. Implement Caching Strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1, 22.2
### Description: Design and implement multi-level caching to reduce computational and I/O overhead.
### Details:
Implement application-level caching for frequently accessed data. Set up distributed caching using Redis or Memcached. Implement HTTP caching headers for client-side caching. Create cache invalidation strategies to maintain data consistency. Monitor cache hit/miss ratios and optimize cache policies.

## 5. Implement Batch Processing and Asynchronous Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1, 22.3
### Description: Optimize performance by implementing batch processing for resource-intensive operations.
### Details:
Identify operations that can be batched together. Implement bulk database operations instead of individual queries. Move resource-intensive operations to background jobs. Implement message queues for asynchronous processing. Optimize batch sizes based on performance testing.

## 6. Implement Load Balancing and Horizontal Scaling [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.3, 22.4, 22.5
### Description: Set up load balancing and horizontal scaling to distribute workload across multiple instances.
### Details:
Configure load balancer to distribute traffic evenly. Implement session persistence strategies if needed. Ensure application is stateless or uses distributed state management. Set up auto-scaling based on load metrics. Test failover scenarios and ensure high availability. Document the scaling strategy and deployment procedures.
