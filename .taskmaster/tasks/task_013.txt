# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Audit Logging and Compliance Reporting
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop comprehensive audit logging and compliance reporting features for security monitoring and regulatory requirements.
# Details:
1. Design structured audit log format with correlation IDs
2. Implement audit logging for all sensitive operations
3. Create log storage with encryption and integrity protection
4. Develop compliance report generation
5. Add log search and filtering capabilities
6. Implement log rotation and retention policies
7. Create alerting for suspicious activities
8. Add support for external log aggregation systems

Example audit log entry:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-11-15T12:34:56Z",
  "event_type": "key_creation",
  "user_id": "user-123",
  "resource_id": "key-456",
  "action": "create",
  "status": "success",
  "client_ip": "192.168.1.1",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "request_id": "req-789",
  "details": {
    "key_type": "ecdsa",
    "key_usage": "signing"
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for audit logging
2. Verify log format and content
3. Test log storage and retrieval
4. Verify compliance report generation
5. Test log search and filtering
6. Verify log rotation and retention
7. Test alerting functionality
8. Verify integration with external systems
9. Test performance impact of audit logging

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design comprehensive audit log format and schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the structure and schema for audit logs, including required fields such as timestamp, user ID, action type, resource affected, IP address, and result status.
### Details:
Create a detailed specification document for the audit log format that ensures all security-relevant events are captured. Include standardized event types, severity levels, and ensure the format supports future extensibility. Consider compliance requirements from GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, and other relevant frameworks to ensure all necessary data points are included.

## 2. Implement sensitive operation logging mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Develop the code to intercept and log all security-sensitive operations across the application, including authentication events, data access, configuration changes, and privileged actions.
### Details:
Create middleware/interceptors for all application layers that require audit logging. Implement hooks in authentication services, data access layers, and admin functions. Ensure logging occurs at appropriate points in the request lifecycle and captures both successful and failed operations. Include context-aware logging that records the complete details of sensitive actions.

## 3. Develop secure log storage and integrity protection [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Implement secure storage for audit logs with tamper-evident mechanisms, encryption, and access controls to maintain log integrity and confidentiality.
### Details:
Set up dedicated log storage with encryption at rest and in transit. Implement digital signatures or hash chains to detect log tampering. Configure strict access controls limiting who can view or manage logs. Consider using append-only storage mechanisms and implement backup procedures. Ensure the storage solution can handle the expected log volume with appropriate scaling capabilities.

## 4. Create compliance report generation system [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2, 13.3
### Description: Build a flexible reporting engine that can generate compliance reports in various formats (PDF, CSV, JSON) with filtering capabilities based on time periods, event types, and users.
### Details:
Develop a reporting API and UI that allows authorized users to generate compliance reports. Implement templates for common compliance frameworks. Include data aggregation and statistical analysis features. Ensure reports can be scheduled and automatically distributed to stakeholders. Add digital signing of generated reports to verify authenticity.

## 5. Implement log retention policies and advanced search capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3, 13.4
### Description: Develop mechanisms to enforce configurable log retention periods and implement advanced search functionality to quickly locate specific audit events.
### Details:
Create a policy engine to manage log lifecycle including archiving and deletion based on configurable retention periods. Implement a search interface with advanced filtering, full-text search, and pattern matching capabilities. Add alerting functionality for specific security events. Ensure the search performance remains efficient even with large log volumes by implementing appropriate indexing strategies.
