# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Key Lifecycle Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop comprehensive key lifecycle management including secure generation, rotation, versioning, backup, and recovery mechanisms.
# Details:
1. Design and implement key metadata structure with versioning
2. Create key rotation mechanisms with configurable policies
3. Implement secure key backup with encryption
4. Develop key recovery procedures with proper authentication
5. Implement key escrow functionality for compliance
6. Create key usage tracking and analytics
7. Implement key expiration and renewal processes
8. Design and implement key state transitions (active, inactive, compromised, etc.)
9. Create audit trail for all key lifecycle events

Example structures:
```go
type KeyMetadata struct {
  ID          string
  Version     int
  CreatedAt   time.Time
  UpdatedAt   time.Time
  ExpiresAt   time.Time
  Status      KeyStatus
  Usage       KeyUsage
  Permissions []Permission
  Tags        map[string]string
}

type KeyLifecycleManager interface {
  CreateKey(params KeyParams) (*ManagedKey, error)
  RotateKey(id string) (*ManagedKey, error)
  RevokeKey(id string, reason string) error
  BackupKey(id string) ([]byte, error)
  RecoverKey(backup []byte, auth Auth) (*ManagedKey, error)
  GetKeyHistory(id string) ([]KeyMetadata, error)
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for all lifecycle management functions
2. Integration tests for complete lifecycle workflows
3. Verify proper audit trail generation
4. Test key rotation under load
5. Verify backup and recovery procedures
6. Test key escrow functionality
7. Verify proper permission enforcement
8. Test concurrent operations on the same key
9. Verify performance meets requirements under various conditions

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Key Metadata Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and implement the comprehensive metadata structure for cryptographic keys
### Details:
Create a schema that includes key ID, creation date, expiration date, algorithm, key length, purpose, owner, access control lists, usage restrictions, rotation history, compliance tags, and current status. Implement the data model in the database and create the corresponding entity classes in the application.

## 2. Implement Key Rotation Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop automated and manual key rotation processes with version control
### Details:
Create a rotation service that supports scheduled automatic rotations based on policy, manual rotation triggers, and emergency rotation procedures. Implement version tracking to maintain relationships between key generations while ensuring proper transition periods where both old and new keys remain valid. Include notification mechanisms for upcoming rotations.

## 3. Develop Backup and Recovery Procedures [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create secure backup systems and recovery workflows for keys
### Details:
Implement encrypted backup storage for keys with appropriate access controls. Design and implement recovery workflows including authorization requirements, multi-party approval processes, and secure recovery channels. Create verification procedures to validate recovered keys and document the complete recovery process.

## 4. Implement Key Escrow System [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.3
### Description: Design and implement a secure key escrow system for critical keys
### Details:
Develop a key escrow system that securely splits and stores key components across multiple trusted custodians. Implement the cryptographic mechanisms for key splitting and reconstruction. Create the authorization workflow for escrow access including multi-party approval and emergency access procedures.

## 5. Create Key Usage Tracking System [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Implement comprehensive tracking of key usage throughout the system
### Details:
Develop a logging system that captures all key operations including encryption/decryption events, signing operations, and verification attempts. Record contextual information such as requesting user/service, timestamp, operation type, and success/failure status. Implement aggregation and reporting capabilities for usage patterns and anomaly detection.

## 6. Implement Key Expiration Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.5
### Description: Develop mechanisms to manage key expiration lifecycle
### Details:
Create a service to monitor key expiration dates and trigger appropriate actions. Implement notification systems for upcoming expirations, automatic rotation options, and graceful deprecation processes. Develop procedures for handling expired keys including archival, revocation publishing, and validation rejection.

## 7. Implement Comprehensive Audit Trail [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6
### Description: Create a tamper-evident audit system for all key lifecycle events
### Details:
Develop a secure audit logging system that records all key lifecycle events including creation, modification, rotation, usage, expiration, and deletion. Implement tamper-evident storage using cryptographic techniques. Create audit review interfaces with filtering and search capabilities. Ensure compliance with relevant regulations by capturing required audit information.
