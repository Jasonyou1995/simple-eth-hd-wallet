# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Multi-Blockchain Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop support for multiple blockchain networks including Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, and Layer 2 solutions.
# Details:
1. Design blockchain provider interface
2. Implement Ethereum (EVM) support
3. Add Bitcoin and Bitcoin-like chains support
4. Implement Solana support
5. Add Layer 2 solutions (Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon)
6. Create address derivation for each blockchain
7. Implement transaction signing for each blockchain
8. Add blockchain-specific operations

Example interface:
```go
type BlockchainProvider interface {
  GenerateAddress(keyPath string) (Address, error)
  SignTransaction(keyPath string, transaction Transaction) (SignedTransaction, error)
  VerifyTransaction(transaction SignedTransaction) (bool, error)
  GetBalance(address Address) (Balance, error)
  BroadcastTransaction(transaction SignedTransaction) (TransactionID, error)
}

type EthereumProvider struct {
  // Implementation
}

type BitcoinProvider struct {
  // Implementation
}

type SolanaProvider struct {
  // Implementation
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for each blockchain provider
2. Test address generation and validation
3. Verify transaction signing
4. Test with testnet environments
5. Verify compatibility with blockchain standards
6. Test with different transaction types
7. Verify error handling for blockchain operations
8. Test performance of blockchain operations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Blockchain Provider Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a unified interface that all blockchain implementations will adhere to
### Details:
Design a provider interface with common methods like getBalance(), sendTransaction(), signMessage(), getAddress(), etc. Include proper abstraction for blockchain-specific features while maintaining a consistent API. Document the interface thoroughly with expected behaviors and error handling requirements.

## 2. Implement Ethereum Blockchain Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Create the Ethereum implementation of the blockchain provider interface
### Details:
Implement Ethereum provider using ethers.js or web3.js. Support EIP-1559 transactions, contract interactions, ERC-20/721 token standards, and gas estimation. Include proper error handling for network issues and transaction failures. Add comprehensive unit tests for all Ethereum-specific functionality.

## 3. Implement Bitcoin Blockchain Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Create the Bitcoin implementation of the blockchain provider interface
### Details:
Implement Bitcoin provider using bitcoinjs-lib. Support different address formats (legacy, segwit, taproot), UTXO management, fee estimation, and transaction building. Handle Bitcoin-specific concepts like script types and signature hash types. Create unit tests for Bitcoin transaction creation and signing.

## 4. Implement Solana Blockchain Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Create the Solana implementation of the blockchain provider interface
### Details:
Implement Solana provider using @solana/web3.js. Support SPL tokens, program interactions, and Solana's account model. Handle Solana's unique transaction structure, recent blockhash requirements, and commitment levels. Create comprehensive tests for Solana-specific functionality.

## 5. Add Layer 2 Solutions Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2
### Description: Extend the provider interface to support Ethereum Layer 2 solutions
### Details:
Implement support for popular L2 networks like Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync. Handle L2-specific transaction formats, fee structures, and bridging operations. Create abstraction layers for L2-specific features while maintaining compatibility with the base provider interface. Test L2 transactions and interactions thoroughly.

## 6. Implement Cross-Chain Address Derivation and Transaction Signing [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, 16.5
### Description: Create unified systems for deriving addresses and signing transactions across all supported blockchains
### Details:
Implement HD wallet derivation paths for all supported chains (BIP-44, BIP-49, BIP-84). Create a unified transaction signing interface that handles different signature algorithms (ECDSA, EdDSA). Support hardware wallet integrations for multi-chain signing. Implement comprehensive test suite covering derivation and signing across all supported chains.
