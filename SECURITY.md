# SKMS Security Guide

## Overview

SKMS (Secure Key Management System) implements multiple layers of security to protect cryptographic keys and mnemonic phrases. This document outlines the security features, best practices, and potential risks.

## üîê Security Features Implemented

### 1. Secure Random Generation

- **Implementation**: Uses `crypto/rand` package for cryptographically secure random number generation
- **Purpose**: Ensures high-quality entropy for mnemonic generation
- **Benefits**:
  - Hardware-based randomness when available
  - Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG)
  - Resistance to prediction attacks

### 2. Memory Security

- **Secure Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of sensitive data using Go finalizers
- **Implementation Details**:
  ```go
  // Sensitive data structures have finalizers
  runtime.SetFinalizer(wallet, (*SimpleWallet).cleanup)
  ```
- **Benefits**:
  - Automatic zeroing of memory containing private keys
  - Reduces exposure time of sensitive data
  - Protects against memory dumps

### 3. Thread-Safe Operations

- **Implementation**: Fine-grained locking with `sync.RWMutex`
- **Protection**: Concurrent access to wallet state
- **Benefits**:
  - Prevents race conditions
  - Ensures data integrity in multi-threaded environments
  - Safe for concurrent operations

### 4. Input Validation & Sanitization

- **Mnemonic Validation**: Comprehensive BIP-39 word list validation
- **Parameter Validation**: Range checking for entropy levels and account indices
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages without leaking sensitive data
- **Implementation**:
  ```go
  func (w *SimpleWallet) validateMnemonic(mnemonic string) error {
      words := strings.Fields(strings.TrimSpace(mnemonic))
      if len(words) < 12 || len(words) > 24 {
          return fmt.Errorf("invalid mnemonic length: %d words", len(words))
      }
      // ... additional validation
  }
  ```

### 5. BIP Standards Compliance

- **BIP-39**: Mnemonic phrase generation and validation
- **BIP-44**: Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet derivation path
- **Derivation Path**: `m/44'/60'/0'/0/index` (Ethereum standard)
- **Benefits**:
  - Interoperability with other wallets
  - Standardized key derivation
  - Predictable account generation

### 6. Constant-Time Operations (Design)

- **Purpose**: Prevent timing attacks
- **Implementation**: Designed to avoid variable-time operations in cryptographic functions
- **Note**: Go's standard library crypto packages implement constant-time operations where appropriate

## üö® Security Warnings

### Critical Warnings

1. **Never use generated keys with real funds without verification**
2. **Always verify addresses with multiple tools before use**
3. **Store mnemonic phrases securely offline**
4. **Never share private keys or mnemonic phrases**
5. **Use only on trusted, secure systems**

### Network Security

- **Air-Gapped Recommended**: Run on offline systems for maximum security
- **No Network Communication**: SKMS never connects to the internet
- **Local Generation**: All cryptographic operations performed locally

### Physical Security

- **Secure Environment**: Use only on trusted hardware
- **Screen Privacy**: Ensure no one can observe displayed keys
- **Clean Exit**: Always use proper command termination
- **Secure Disposal**: Properly wipe systems after use

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

### For Production Use

1. **Verification Workflow**

   ```bash
   # Generate mnemonic
   ./bin/skms generate 256

   # Derive first account
   ./bin/skms derive "your mnemonic phrase" 0

   # Verify with external tools (MetaMask, Hardware Wallet, etc.)
   ```

2. **Multiple Tool Verification**

   - Use at least 2-3 different tools to verify the same mnemonic
   - Compare derived addresses across tools
   - Never use unverified addresses with real funds

3. **Secure Storage**
   - Store mnemonic phrases on paper/metal (offline)
   - Use BIP-39 passphrase for additional security layer
   - Consider multi-signature setups for large amounts
   - Use hardware wallets for regular transactions

### For Development

1. **Test Environment Isolation**

   ```bash
   # Use known test mnemonics for development
   TEST_MNEMONIC="abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon about"

   # Never use development keys with real funds
   ```

2. **Automated Testing**

   ```bash
   # Run comprehensive test suite
   ./test_skms.sh

   # Verify deterministic generation
   # Check randomness of new mnemonics
   ```

## üîç Validation Methods

### Internal Validation

- BIP-39 word list compliance
- Checksum verification (last word validation)
- Entropy level validation
- Address format validation

### External Validation Tools

1. **Online Tools** (Use only with test data):

   - [BIP39 Tool](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/)
   - [MyCrypto](https://mycrypto.com/)
   - [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/)

2. **Hardware Wallets**:

   - Ledger
   - Trezor
   - SafePal

3. **Software Wallets**:
   - MetaMask
   - Trust Wallet
   - Exodus

### Cross-Verification Example

```bash
# Generate with SKMS
./bin/skms generate 128

# Verify the mnemonic produces the same addresses in:
# 1. MetaMask (import mnemonic)
# 2. Ian Coleman's BIP39 tool
# 3. Hardware wallet (if available)
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Security

### Minimalist Design

- **Zero External Dependencies**: Only Go standard library
- **Small Attack Surface**: Minimal code reduces vulnerability risk
- **Transparent Implementation**: All cryptographic operations visible

### Code Security Features

- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking
- **Input Bounds**: Range validation on all parameters
- **Memory Management**: Explicit cleanup of sensitive data
- **Type Safety**: Go's strong typing prevents many vulnerabilities

## üß™ Testing Security

### Automated Security Tests

The test suite (`test_skms.sh`) includes:

1. **Randomness Tests**: Verify different mnemonics are generated
2. **Deterministic Tests**: Verify same input produces same output
3. **Input Validation**: Test invalid inputs are rejected
4. **Format Validation**: Verify output formats are correct
5. **Performance Tests**: Ensure reasonable execution times

### Manual Security Verification

```bash
# Test 1: Randomness
./bin/skms generate > test1.txt
./bin/skms generate > test2.txt
diff test1.txt test2.txt  # Should be different

# Test 2: Deterministic
MNEMONIC="abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon about"
./bin/skms derive "$MNEMONIC" 0 > result1.txt
./bin/skms derive "$MNEMONIC" 0 > result2.txt
diff result1.txt result2.txt  # Should be identical

# Cleanup
rm test1.txt test2.txt result1.txt result2.txt
```

## üö´ Known Limitations

### Current Limitations

2. **Ethereum Only**: Currently supports only Ethereum key derivation
3. **No Hardware Security Module (HSM)**: No HSM integration
4. **No Multi-Signature**: Single-key generation only

### Future Security Enhancements

1. **BIP-39 Passphrase Support**: Additional security layer
2. **Multi-Currency Support**: Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies
3. **HSM Integration**: Hardware security module support
4. **Advanced Entropy Sources**: Multiple entropy sources combination
5. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Privacy-preserving validations

4. Review security procedures
5. Implement additional security measures

## üìû Support & Reporting

### Security Issues

- **Never** share actual mnemonic phrases or private keys in bug reports

- Report security vulnerabilities through secure channels
- Include steps to reproduce with test data only

### Verification Support

For questions about address verification or security procedures, always use test data in examples and never share real cryptographic material.
